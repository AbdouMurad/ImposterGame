Defining what all the json messages sent between frontend and backend mean and what fields they should include

Each json message should start with a 'type' field that defines what the request/message is trying to do. (for example 'type' : 'create-room' would be at the top of a request from frontend to backend to creaate a room)

Frontend -> Backend:

    #request to create a room
    create-room:
        playerid
        name

    #request to join a room by code
    join-room
        playerid
        name
        roomid

    #request to start the game
    start-game
        playerid
        name
        roomid
    
    #request list of players
    request-list
        playerid
        name
        roomid

    #request the time
    request-time
        roomid
        playerid
        
    #request list of players in order of turns
    request-order
        playerid 
        name
        roomid

    #request most recent source code of quesiton (only after game has started)
    request-code
        playerid
        name
        roomid

    #request the tests cases for the given question
    request-tests
        playerid
        roomid

    run-test
        playerid
        name
        roomid
        source-code

    request-logs
        playerid
        roomid
